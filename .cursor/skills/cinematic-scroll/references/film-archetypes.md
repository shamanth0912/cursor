# Visual Systems for Scroll Design

> Every scroll site has a visual system. This file lets you choose yours intentionally.

Each system below maps concrete scroll design principles — pacing, color, type, depth, and transitions — to a production-ready visual language. When a brief aligns with a system, every design decision becomes easier because you are working from a coherent visual language, not a mood board.

---

## 1. Symmetric Monument

*Visual language inspired by meticulous classical composition and architectural precision*

### Scroll Behavior
One-point perspective, slow deliberate movement, and absolute symmetry. The scroll axis becomes a corridor — the user moves forward into depth, not sideways across a page. Every pinned section is a "room" viewed from a single fixed vantage point. The camera never rushes. Reveals happen at glacial speed, forcing the user to sit with the composition before the next element arrives.

### Color Philosophy
Desaturated primaries with sudden violent accents. A Symmetric Monument palette lives in muted creams, cold institutional blues, and warm tungsten ambers — then a single frame of arterial red shatters the calm. Color is not decoration; it is narrative punctuation. Use `#C41E3A` against `#E8E0D4` and let the red do all the screaming.

### Pacing Signature
Slow, symmetrical, metronomic. Pins run 300-400vh (the upper limit — the pacing earns it). Title reveals take 40% of the pin range. Stagger is wide: 12-15% between elements, creating space for the composition to accumulate. Easing is `power1.inOut` — no drama in the curve, all drama in the duration.

### Typographic Voice
Geometric sans-serif (Futura, SF Mono), tracked out, centered, monumental. Titles at 120px+, all caps, `letter-spacing: 0.15em`. Body copy is small, almost whispered — 14px, `line-height: 1.6`, left-aligned in narrow 40ch columns. The contrast between screaming titles and timid body creates hierarchy through aggression.

### Depth Strategy
4-5 layers maximum, arranged in strict one-point perspective. Background layers drift at 0.1x and 0.25x. Midground holds the subject at 0.5x. Foreground elements (door frames, architectural edges) at 0.8x. The vanishing point never moves. All layers converge to a single coordinate — typically 50% horizontal, 40% vertical.

### Transition Style
Hard cuts. No fade, no slide, no dissolve. One section ends; the next begins instantly. The harshness of the cut is the transition. If a color morph is necessary, it happens inside a single pinned section — never between sections.

### Applied Example
A **law firm** wanting **authority and stillness** should reference this. A **museum** wanting **classical reverence** should reference this. A **luxury real estate** brand selling **architectural space** should reference this.

## 2. Clinical Noir

*Visual language inspired by precision, data visualization, and invisible technique*

### Scroll Behavior
Meticulous precision, data-driven composition, and invisible technique. The scroll feels like a camera on a dolly track — perfectly smooth, no vibration, no flourish. Information arrives on a need-to-know basis. The user scrolls and something is revealed, but the mechanism of the reveal is invisible. No snap scroll. No whip pans. The motion is the absence of motion.

### Color Philosophy
Desaturated to the point of near-monochrome. This system's palette is ash grey, steel blue, sickly yellow-green, and black. Saturation never exceeds 30%. When color does appear — a warm skin tone, a red wine stain — it reads as an event because the surrounding world has been drained of it. Use `#3A3A3A`, `#7A8B99`, `#2C2C2C` as base; introduce `#C9A96E` (amber) only for interactive elements.

### Pacing Signature
Medium-slow, uniform, relentless. 200-250vh pins. Title reveals are 35% of pin range — not rushed, not leisurely. Stagger at 6-8%. The rhythm is a heartbeat: consistent, unhurried, unsettling in its regularity. Easing is `power2.inOut` — smooth acceleration and deceleration, no accent, no personality. The curve says "this is inevitable."

### Typographic Voice
Helvetica Neue (or Inter, or SF Pro), medium weight, meticulously sized. Titles at 64-80px, sentence case, `letter-spacing: -0.02em` (tight, confident). Body at 16px, `line-height: 1.6`, neutral. No serifs. No personality in the type — the personality is in the spacing, the sizing, the silence around the words.

### Depth Strategy
3 layers, shallow depth. Background at 0.15x, content at 0.5x, a subtle texture overlay at 0.9x. This system does not do deep parallax — depth is implied through focus, not motion. The shallow stack keeps the composition flat and controlled, like a framed photograph that happens to move slightly.

### Transition Style
Fade through black. Not a crossfade — a fade-to-black, hold for one beat (20vh of scroll darkness), then fade up to the next chapter. The darkness is a palate cleanser. It resets the user's visual state before the next information payload arrives.

### Applied Example
A **fintech app** wanting **trust and precision** should reference this. A **SaaS platform** wanting **clinical professionalism** should reference this. A **news organization** wanting **gravitas without pomposity** should reference this.

---

## 3. Storybook Geometry

*Visual language inspired by playful symmetry, bright color fields, and lateral motion*

### Scroll Behavior
Flat, snap-to-grid, centered compositions with lateral movement. The scroll axis becomes a horizontal dolly (even on a vertical page — use `translateX` driven by vertical scroll progress). Every element is centered or perfectly symmetrical. The camera moves in straight lines: left, right, up, down — never diagonal, never organic.

### Color Philosophy
Pastel, saturated, playful. This system's palette is a box of macarons: dusty rose `#D4A5A5`, butter yellow `#F4E4BC`, mint green `#A8D5BA`, baby blue `#A8C8EC`, lavender `#C9B8D8`. Colors do not blend; they butt against each other in hard-edged blocks. Each chapter gets one dominant pastel with a complementary accent.

### Pacing Signature
Fast, rhythmic, symmetrical. Short pins at 150-180vh. Title reveals are snap-quick: `power4.out`, 0.4s duration, word-stagger at 4%. The user should feel like they are flipping through a beautifully designed book, not scrolling a website. Rhythm is everything — the pacing should have a musical quality, like verses in a pop song.

### Typographic Voice
Geometric sans-serif (Futura, Inter) for display, sometimes a slab serif for contrast. Titles at 80-100px, centered, `letter-spacing: 0.08em`, often in all-caps. Body copy is small, centered, almost decorative — 13-14px, `line-height: 1.5`, in narrow 35ch columns. Type is treated as a visual element first, a reading element second.

### Depth Strategy
2-3 layers, explicitly flat. Background is a solid color or simple pattern. Midground holds the subject. Foreground has a decorative border or frame element. Parallax rates are minimal: 0.1x, 0.4x, 0.7x. The flatness is the point — depth is suggested through scale and overlap, not through perspective.

### Transition Style
Hard lateral wipes. One chapter slides out to the left while the next slides in from the right — perfectly synchronized, 0.5s, `power2.inOut`. The wipe is a curtain change between acts. No fade, no dissolve. The seam between chapters is visible and intentional, like turning a page in a pop-up book.

### Applied Example
A **boutique hotel** wanting **whimsical charm** should reference this. A **bakery or food brand** wanting **playful sophistication** should reference this. A **children's product** wanting **nostalgic warmth without childishness** should reference this.

---

## 4. Temporal Monument

*Visual language inspired by dramatic layering, extreme scale shifts, and time-bending transitions*

### Scroll Behavior
Layered timelines, dramatic scale shifts, and time-bending transitions. The scroll experience should feel like moving through nested realities — foreground action, midground context, background cosmic scale, all moving at different rates. Use nested pinned sections (a pin within a pin) to create the "nested worlds" effect. The user scrolls through one timeline and discovers another underneath.

### Color Philosophy
Dramatic chiaroscuro. This system's palette is built on extreme contrast: deep blacks `#0A0A0A`, cold steel highlights `#C8D8E8`, and warm practical lights `#E8C97A` (tungsten, fire, sun). Shadows are not grey — they are black. Highlights are not white — they are colored by their source. Every frame reads as a painting by candlelight or starlight.

### Pacing Signature
Variable, relentless, driven by narrative momentum. Alternate between 250vh slow-burn pins (dialogue, exposition) and 120vh high-velocity snaps (action, transition). The contrast between slow and fast creates the feeling of unstoppable momentum. Easing: `power3.inOut` for slow sections, `power4.in` for snap transitions.

### Typographic Voice
Clean sans-serif (Gotham, Montserrat, or similar) for titles, large and authoritative — 100px+, `font-weight: 700`, `letter-spacing: -0.03em`. Body copy is neutral, readable, almost invisible — 15px, `line-height: 1.7`. The type does not draw attention to itself; it delivers information so the visuals can do the dramatic work.

### Depth Strategy
5-7 layers — the deepest stack of any system. Background cosmic/environmental layers at 0.05x and 0.12x. Architectural/context layers at 0.25x and 0.4x. Subject layers at 0.6x and 0.75x. A foreground detail layer at 0.9x. The extreme depth separation between background (nearly static) and foreground (fast) creates the sense of cosmic scale.

### Transition Style
Inversion cuts. One section's color palette is the photographic negative of the next — warm → cold, bright → dark, saturated → desaturated. The transition is not a motion but a reality shift. Accompany with a `rotateX(2deg)` tilt that rights itself over the first 20% of the new pin.

### Applied Example
A **space or deep-tech startup** wanting **cosmic scale** should reference this. A **venture capital firm** wanting **ambition and gravity** should reference this. A **cinematic game launch** wanting **event-level drama** should reference this.

## 5. Atmospheric Sublime

*Visual language inspired by vast negative space, atmospheric haze, and slow revelation*

### Scroll Behavior
Vast negative space, atmospheric haze, and slow revelation. The user scrolls through emptiness — a desert, a fog bank, a dark screen — and gradually, impossibly slowly, forms emerge from the atmosphere. The scroll is not about delivering information quickly; it is about creating the conditions for awe. Every pinned section starts empty and ends populated.

### Color Philosophy
Atmospheric, desaturated, warm-cold duality. This system shifts between two registers: warm dust (ochre `#B8956A`, sand `#C4A882`, haze `#D4C5A9`) and cold steel (slate `#5A6670`, ice `#8BA4B4`, shadow `#1E2328`). No bright primaries. No saturated greens. The world is either burning or freezing, and the tension between the two is the palette's engine.

### Pacing Signature
Glacial, then sudden. Pins at 280-350vh — the longest of any system. The first 60% of the pin is atmospheric: background drifts, haze thickens, a distant shape becomes barely visible. The final 40% delivers the reveal: title, subject, call-to-action. The asymmetry is crucial — the wait must be longer than the payoff, or the payoff feels cheap. Easing: `none` (linear) for atmospheric drift; `power2.out` for the reveal.

### Typographic Voice
Sharp, thin, spaced-out sans-serif (Helvetica Neue Light, or thin weight Inter). Titles at 90-120px, `font-weight: 200`, `letter-spacing: 0.2em`, uppercase. The thinness of the type lets it sit lightly on the image — it does not compete with the visual atmosphere, it annotates it. Body copy is minimal: 14px, `line-height: 1.8`, never more than 3 short paragraphs per chapter.

### Depth Strategy
3-4 layers, but used for atmosphere, not objects. Layer 1 (0.05x): background image, slow drift. Layer 2 (0.2x): atmospheric haze / gradient overlay, opacity shifts with scroll. Layer 3 (0.5x): primary subject, revealed late. Layer 4 (0.85x): dust particles or texture, subtle parallax. The haze layer is the secret weapon — a semi-transparent gradient that shifts opacity based on scroll progress, creating the sense of emerging from fog.

### Transition Style
Atmospheric bleed. The outgoing section's haze expands to fill the viewport (opacity 0 → 1 over 40vh), holds (20vh), then the incoming section's haze contracts (opacity 1 → 0). The user never sees a hard edge — they move through a cloud between worlds.

### Applied Example
An **automotive brand** wanting **scale and presence** should reference this. A **premium spirits** company wanting **ritual and atmosphere** should reference this. A **documentary or nature brand** wanting **reverence for landscape** should reference this.

## 6. Warm Scrapbook

*Visual language inspired by intimate character, playful imperfection, and conversational rhythm*

### Scroll Behavior
Warm, intimate, character-driven, with playful formal experiments. The scroll feels like flipping through a personal scrapbook — handwritten notes, pressed flowers, Polaroid snapshots, all arranged with affectionate chaos. Motion is quick, energetic, and slightly imperfect. Elements do not glide; they bounce, wobble, and settle. The imperfection is the point.

### Color Philosophy
Warm, saturated, emotionally direct. This system's palette is a summer afternoon: warm pink `#E8927C`, butter yellow `#F5D76E`, sage green `#8FA68E`, dusty blue `#7BA7BC`, cream `#F5F0E8`. Colors are saturated but not electric — they feel found, not designed. Each chapter has a dominant warmth that shifts subtly in hue (rose → peach → amber) to create emotional progression.

### Pacing Signature
Quick, varied, conversational. Short pins at 150-200vh. Rapid title reveals (word-stagger at 5%, `back.out(1.2)` easing — the slight overshoot feels hand-placed, not machine-perfect). Unexpected pauses: a 30vh "breathing room" section with nothing but a centered quote in italic script. The rhythm mimics conversation — quick, quick, pause, quick, longer pause.

### Typographic Voice
Friendly, open sans-serif for body (Inter, -apple-system), with occasional hand-drawn or script display type for headlines. Titles at 70-90px, warm and approachable, sometimes all-caps, sometimes sentence-case, sometimes a playful MiXeD case. Body at 16px, `line-height: 1.8`, warm and conversational. The type should feel like it was chosen by a friend, not an algorithm.

### Depth Strategy
2-3 layers, warm and shallow. Background: a soft color or subtle pattern, no movement. Midground: the main content, subtle parallax (0.3x-0.4x). Foreground: decorative elements — hand-drawn shapes, stamps, sketches — at 0.8x-0.9x. The foreground should look like it was collaged on top.

### Transition Style
Soft dissolve with a brief scale pop. As one chapter fades out (opacity 1 → 0 over 15vh) the next fades in (opacity 0 → 1 over 15vh), and a foreground element (like a stamp or shape) briefly scales up to 1.05x then back down to 1.0x. The effect is handmade, not machine-perfect.

### Applied Example
A **boutique or craft brand** wanting **authenticity and warmth** should reference this. A **children's or family service** wanting **approachable joy** should reference this. A **personal brand or portfolio** wanting **humanity and relatability** should reference this.

## 7. Naturalistic Drift

*Visual language inspired by observational precision, subtle motion, and lived-in authenticity*

### Scroll Behavior
Naturalistic, observational, with subtle camera motion that feels almost unscripted. The scroll should feel like watching real life through a patient, contemplative lens — not cinematic, not stylized, but deeply observed. Motion is minimal and organic: a slight drift, a gentle float, the way light might move across a room. The user should feel like they are discovering something authentic, not experiencing a designed effect.

### Color Philosophy
Naturalistic, lived-in, slightly desaturated. This system's palette draws from real environments: muted greens `#7A8B6F`, warm earth tones `#A89080`, soft yellows `#D4C19A`, cool shadows `#6B7D8A`, and gentle greys `#9B9B9B`. Colors shift subtly across chapters, following light and time of day rather than dramatic artistic choices. The palette should feel like it was observed, not invented.

### Pacing Signature
Slow, patient, observational. Medium pins at 200-280vh. Title reveals are gradual and unhurried — the text fades in slowly (`opacity 0 → 1` over 60vh) rather than snapping into view. Word-stagger is minimal (2-3%), and easing is `linear` or `sine.inOut` — no artificial dramatization. The pacing respects the user's time and attention.

### Typographic Voice
Readable, neutral serif or warm sans-serif (Georgia, Crimson Text, or Inter Light for body). Titles at 60-80px, in sentence case, `font-weight: 400`, giving them the weight of quiet observation rather than proclamation. Body at 17-18px, `line-height: 1.8`, with ample breathing room. The type should be invisible — you read the meaning, not the letterforms.

### Depth Strategy
2-3 layers, naturalistic depth. Background: a soft, out-of-focus environmental element (a landscape, a interior space), with minimal drift (0.05x-0.1x). Midground: the primary subject or narrative, at 0.4x-0.5x. Foreground: fine details (a branch, a hand, texture) at 0.8x. The parallax mimics the viewer's actual perspective as they observe a scene.

### Transition Style
Soft fade with a slight vignette. As one chapter ends, the vignette slowly expands inward (darkening the edges over 30vh, making the center feel like a spotlight on the next moment). Then the new chapter's image appears and the vignette resets. The effect is meditative, not mechanical.

### Applied Example
A **documentary or editorial publication** wanting **credible observation** should reference this. A **wellness or lifestyle brand** wanting **authenticity without affectation** should reference this. A **nonprofit or social-mission brand** wanting **lived truth** should reference this.

## 8. Brutalist Kinetic

*Visual language inspired by raw concrete, exposed structure, and unapologetic mechanical motion*

### Scroll Behavior
Hard, declarative, anti-decorative. Elements arrive like stamped machine parts — no easing into place, they *land*. The scroll feels like operating heavy equipment: deliberate, weighty, with audible-looking impacts. Grids are exposed, not hidden; the structure is the ornament.

### Color Philosophy
Raw concrete grays with a single safety-orange warning accent. Base in `#D9D7D0` / `#C7C5BD`, ink at `#141414`, and `#FF4D00` used the way a hazard stripe is used — sparing, functional, loud. No gradients, no soft shadows; color blocks butt together at hard edges.

### Pacing Signature
Mechanical and even. Mid-length pins (160-220vh) with hard `expo.inOut` snaps — motion accelerates and arrests abruptly, never glides. Stagger is tight and machine-regular.

### Typographic Voice
Monospace throughout — display, body, and UI. Titles are large, left-aligned, often with visible baseline grids or coordinate labels. Type reads like a spec sheet that happens to be beautiful.

### Depth Strategy
2 layers, almost flat. Depth comes from hard drop-offsets and overlap, not parallax drift. The flatness is ideological: this system refuses illusion.

### Transition Style
Cut-and-stamp. The next chapter slams in on a hard cut with a 1-2px positional jolt that settles instantly — the visual equivalent of a press closing.

### Applied Example
A **developer tool** wanting **engineering honesty** should reference this. A **streetwear or industrial-design brand** wanting **raw confidence** should reference this.

---

## 9. Liquid Chrome

*Visual language inspired by molten metal, iridescent surfaces, and continuous morphing*

### Scroll Behavior
Everything flows. Surfaces ripple, reflect, and re-form as you scroll — there are no hard edges, only liquid transitions between states. Best paired with a WebGL distortion layer (Tier B+), but degrades to smooth CSS transforms.

### Color Philosophy
Near-black iridescent ground (`#0C0E12` / `#161A22`) with chrome-cyan (`#7DF9FF`) highlights that read like light catching metal. Accents glow against the dark; the palette is cold, reflective, expensive.

### Pacing Signature
Long, smooth, continuous (220-320vh). `power3.out` reveals — fast in, long settle, like mercury finding its level. No snaps; the whole site feels like one continuous pour.

### Typographic Voice
Grotesk display and body (Space Grotesk), spaced confidently. Type can carry a subtle chrome gradient on hero titles, sharp sans for UI.

### Depth Strategy
5 layers with reflective intent — a background environment, a morphing midground subject, and foreground specular highlights that move counter to scroll, simulating reflection.

### Transition Style
Liquid morph. The outgoing composition melts/warps into the incoming one via a shared shader or a `clip-path`/blob morph — never a cut, never a fade.

### Applied Example
A **crypto/fintech or audio-hardware brand** wanting **premium futurism** should reference this. A **fashion label** wanting **cold glamour** should reference this.

---

## 10. Botanical Editorial

*Visual language inspired by pressed-paper publishing, botanical illustration, and patient editorial rhythm*

### Scroll Behavior
Calm, page-like, considered. The scroll reads like turning the leaves of a beautifully set book — generous margins, asymmetric editorial columns, imagery that breathes. Motion is gentle and organic, never mechanical.

### Color Philosophy
Warm paper (`#F3F1E7` / `#FAF8EE`) with a deep leaf-green accent (`#4A6B3A`) and near-black ink. The palette is grown, not designed: muted greens, soft earth, the warmth of uncoated stock.

### Pacing Signature
Patient (200-260vh). `sine.inOut` reveals — soft, symmetrical, unhurried. Wide breathing room between chapters; the rhythm respects reading, not spectacle.

### Typographic Voice
Editorial serif for display *and* body (Crimson Text), with a clean sans for labels. Large drop-cap-friendly headings, generous leading, narrow measure for readability.

### Depth Strategy
3 shallow layers — a soft paper texture, the editorial content plane, and lightly drifting botanical illustrations at 0.3-0.4x that feel pressed onto the page.

### Transition Style
Soft page-turn fade with a faint paper grain that holds through the cut, like the next spread settling.

### Applied Example
A **publication, tea/wellness brand, or independent press** wanting **literary warmth** should reference this. A **sustainable goods brand** wanting **considered authenticity** should reference this.

---

## 11. Data Cinematic

*Visual language inspired by dramatized data visualization, mission-control interfaces, and glowing precision*

### Scroll Behavior
Information as spectacle. Numbers count up, charts draw themselves, coordinates lock on — but choreographed cinematically, with dramatic timing rather than dashboard flatness. The scroll feels like a briefing in a darkened control room.

### Color Philosophy
Deep navy ground (`#0A0F1E` / `#121A30`) with a signal-green accent (`#4FE0B0`) that glows like a live readout. Cool, precise, high-contrast; the dark lets the data luminesce.

### Pacing Signature
Precise and deliberate (200-280vh). `power2.inOut` reveals — even, confident, "this is the data." Numbers and lines animate on scroll progress, never auto-loop.

### Typographic Voice
Grotesk display for headlines, clean sans for body, **monospace for figures and labels** — the mono signals "this is measured." Tabular numerals, tight tracking.

### Depth Strategy
4 layers — a subtle grid/constellation background, the data plane, annotation callouts, and a foreground HUD frame. Parallax is restrained; precision over drift.

### Transition Style
Lock-on wipe. The next chapter's frame draws in like a targeting reticle acquiring focus, with the accent tracing the new boundary.

### Applied Example
An **analytics/observability platform, space or defense-tech brand** wanting **authoritative drama** should reference this. A **research org** wanting **data with gravity** should reference this.
