# Recipe catalog

Read this catalog once, choose the primary experience, and open only its recipe.
Each recipe contains a complete default approach. The source column is optional:
inspect one listed file only when the host project or a missing mechanism makes it
necessary. Copy behavior and lifecycle contracts, never the example's identity.

## Starting routes

| Primary experience | Recipe | Optional source when blocked | Dependencies | Mobile / static |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Image-led campaign, portfolio, or longread | [Editorial story](recipes/editorial-story.md) | `examples/renaissance/index.html` for alternating image/copy chapters; `examples/v3-flagship/` for a compact interactive study | No JS library; Renaissance loads optional Google Fonts, so substitute local/system fonts for offline use | Natural reading flow; images and controls remain usable without motion |
| Launch, product detail, or mechanism reveal | [Product reveal](recipes/product-reveal.md) | `examples/luxe/index.html` for one state shared across the story; `examples/kern-calibration/` for scrubbed media | Luxe: none. KERN: one local MP4; optional generation is separate | Stable product plate or poster, stacked evidence, same action |
| GLB, procedural object, orbit, or camera flight | [Real-time 3D](recipes/real-time-3d.md) | `examples/crystalline-monolith/index.html` for procedural Three.js; `examples/flagship/` or `templates/nextjs/components/flagship/` for GLB loading | One consistent Three.js version; GLTFLoader plus matching decoders when the asset needs them | Permanent poster; bounded/static scene for reduced motion and low capability |

## Mechanism shelf

| Need | Reuse | Adapt | Dependency and fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pinned chapter with readable reveal | `components/mode-a/pinned-reveal.html` or `components/mode-b/pinned-reveal.tsx` | Pin distance, copy rhythm, focal asset | Existing GSAP in the component; free-flow readable section |
| Multi-plane hero | `hero-parallax` component | Crops, depth ratios, focal point | Existing component dependency; two layers on narrow screens, still frame for reduced motion |
| Image/object depth card | `depth-figure` component | Image, caption, restrained depth | Tilt only for hover/fine pointer; flat card otherwise |
| Product card response | `tilt-card` component | Surface material and information hierarchy | Flat focusable card on touch/reduced motion |
| Atmosphere or chapter color change | `morph-background` component | Two brand-derived grounds and contrast scrim | Crossfade layers; first ground is the static state |
| Collection or archive | `horizontal-gallery` component | Card widths, labels, sequence | Sticky translation on capable desktop; native horizontal overflow otherwise |
| Frame-accurate product/media reveal | `scrub-video` component; `examples/kern-calibration/` | Clip, poster, hold points, captions | Local scrub-ready media; poster when decode, JS, or motion is unavailable |
| Expressive heading | `kinetic-headline` component | Split unit and type rhythm | Plain semantic heading is always present |
| Shared scroll/pointer signals | `runtime/index.mjs`; React adapter in `runtime/react.tsx` | Subscribe one signature interaction | No Three.js dependency in core; dispose every subscription |
| Text, proximity, shader media | `examples/effects-lab/`; `runtime/effects.mjs` | Select one response that reinforces the subject | Quality setting plus readable non-effect state |
| Procedural WebGL object | `examples/crystalline-monolith/index.html` | Geometry, material, lighting, camera path | Pinned Three.js/import-map versions; CSS/poster fallback |
| GLB product/world/figure | `examples/flagship/main.js`; `runtime/assets.tsx` | Manifest path, framing, animation clips | GLTFLoader and asset-specific Draco/Meshopt/KTX2 support; procedural/poster fallback |

## Selection rules

- Use the project's installed animation/rendering stack when it can express the
  mechanism. Add a dependency only when the signature moment needs it.
- Reuse one complete clock/lifecycle pattern rather than mixing loops from examples.
- Start with supplied assets. Record each asset's purpose, focal crop, intrinsic
  size, loading priority, and fallback.
- Use optional deep references only for a concrete issue: `references/mobile-motion.md`
  for a difficult touch composition, `references/interaction-runtime.md` for shared
  signals/effects, and `references/3d-stack.md` for uncommon loader or GPU details.
