# Pattern IR — the canonical schema for every learned unit

> The machine-enforced mirror is `tools/learn/lib/schema.mjs`; keep the two in sync.
> Nothing is written to `references/learned/` until it is a valid Pattern IR object.

The IR is stored as **YAML frontmatter** at the top of each shelf entry. Subset rules
(enforced by `tools/learn/lib/frontmatter.mjs`):

- 2-space-indented nested maps.
- Scalar leaves: double-quoted strings, bare strings, numbers, `true`/`false`, `null`.
- Sequences are **inline JSON arrays with double-quoted strings**: `tags: ["a","b"]` (or `[]`).
  No `- item` block sequences.
- No inline `#` comments inside entries (only full-line comments, and only in this doc's example).
- Empty-string values must be written as `""` (a key with no value opens a nested map).

> **Real entries must be comment-free.** Copy a clean shape from `tools/learn/lib/fixtures.mjs` (`VALID_ENTRY_TEXT`). The `#` annotations in the example below are for illustration only — `parseFrontmatter` will reject any entry that contains them.

**Entry body (below the frontmatter) — Phase 1 mandatory sections:** `## Reusable recipe`,
`## Constraints`, `## Failure modes`, `## Negative twin — what this is NOT`, and at least one
`## Original variant`. These are agent-authored — the heart of "compiler, not scraper."
